## starter for project with react and flux

### intro
clone this repo and start coding here, according to starter's schema and  style

### install
    npm install

### watch develop
    gulp wd


### build system
browerify brings CMD module define and require. 

Since watchify has no error handler( or there is solutions that i don't know), and i am used to use gulp and its system(U SHOULD use it too!), i added plumber as error handler.
